    <h1>Childhood/Education</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When George Washington was eleven years old, his father Augustine died,
      leaving most of his property to George's older half brothers. The income
      from what remained was just sufficient to maintain Mary Washington and her
      children. As the oldest child remaining at home, George undoubtedly
      helped his mother manage the Rappahannock River plantation where they
      lived. There he learned the importance of hard work and efficiency.Unlike
      many of his contemporaries, Washington never attended college or received
      a formal education. His two older brothers, Lawrence and Augustine Washington,
      Jr., attended Appleby Grammar School in England. However, when Washington
      was just 11 years old, his father, Augustine Washington, passed away,
      leaving the family limited funds for education. Private tutors and possibly
      a local school in Fredericksburg provided the young man with the only
      formal instruction he would receive. To augment his studies,
      George Washington, begin to teach himself through reading and
      experimentation. In his early life, three major influences drove
      Washington's path of self-betterment.</p>

      <h1>The French & Indian War</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1753 the Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie, learned that French
        troops had moved south from Canada and were constructing forts in the
        region south of Lake Erie, an area claimed by Virginia (but now in
        Western Pennsylvania). Both France and England recognized the commercial
        potential of the region. French trappers had been working in the area
        for some time, and Dinwiddie was concerned that the French troops would
        also fortify the forks of the Ohio -- the strategic point where the
        Allegheny and Monongahela rivers join to form the Ohio River. This
        point, now Pittsburgh, was the eastern gateway to the Ohio Valley.

      In the fall of 1753 Dinwiddie sent 21-year-old Major Washington to deliver a
      message to the French, demanding they leave the area. With the help of a frontier
      guide and local Indians, Washington reached the French fort, Le Boeuf, with
      Dinwiddie's message. The return trip tested Washington's endurance. He hiked
      for days through snowy woods, fell off a raft into the ice-choked Allegheny River,
      nearly drowned, and was forced to spend a freezing night on an island without
      shelter. His guide, an experienced backwoodsman, suffered frostbite; but Washington
      suffered no ill effects. Washington's account of the arduous 900-mile journey
      was published by Governor Dinwiddie in both Williamsburg and London,
      establishing an international reputation for George Washington by the time
      he was 22.<br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months later Dinwiddie dispatched Washington, now a lieutenant colonel,
      and some 150 men to assert Virginia's claims. As they advanced, Washington's men
      skirmished with French soldiers, killing 10 men, including the French commander.
      Washington then retreated to an ill-placed and makeshift palisade he called Fort
      Necessity. He was forced to surrender when the French surrounded the fort. The
      campaign ended in humiliation for Washington and ignited the French and Indian
      War.

      Although he resigned his commission after the surrender, Washington returned to
      the frontier in 1755 as a volunteer aide to General Edward Braddock. Braddock
      had been sent by the King of England to drive the French from the Ohio Country.
      Braddock's army was routed near the Monongahela River and fled in confusion to
      Virginia. During the battle, while attempting to rally the British soldiers,
      Washington had two horses shot out from under him and four bullet holes shot
      through his coat. Although he behaved with conspicuous bravery, Washington
      could do little except lead the broken survivors to safety.

      In recognition of his conduct, Washington was given command of Virginia's entire
      military force. With a few hundred men he was ordered to protect a frontier some
      350 miles long. Although this was a frustrating assignment, it provided him with
      experience in commanding troops through an arduous campaign. In 1758 the British
      finally took the forks of the Ohio. Peace returned to Virginia, and Washington
      resigned his commission to return to Mount Vernon, his duty faithfully performed.</p>

  <div class="main2">
    <h1>Marriage & Family</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 6th, 1759, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a charming
       and vivacious young woman from the Tidewater area of Virginia. Martha brought
      enormous wealth, along with two small children, “Jacky” and “Patsy,” to the
      marriage. It was her second marriage, his first.

      About two weeks after the battle at Yorktown, Washington’s stepson, John Parke
      Custis (“Jacky”), died of camp fever at the age of 27. Ironically, the spoiled
      and indolent young man had not fought in the war but had, at its end, traveled
      to Yorktown to serve as a civilian aide to his stepfather. He was the last of
      Martha’s remaining children. His sister Patsy had died as a teenager eight years
       earlier following an epileptic seizure. Martha was devastated by Jacky’s death. <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha Washington joined her husband in his winter quarters every year of the war.
       Together they entertained his officers and guests. A patriot in her own right,
       Mrs. Washington made it her war too, nursing sick and wounded soldiers and raising
        money for the troops. Needlework helped her to pass the time through the long,
        cold winters. In all, she would spend about half the war in camp.

      Two of Martha Washington’s grandchildren, Eleanor (“Nelly”) Parke Custis (b. 1779)
       and George Washington (“Washy”) Parke Custis (b. 1781) came to live with their
       grandparents after their father died following the Battle of Yorktown. Washington
        loved his step-grandchildren as his very own.</p>

    <h2>Commander & Cheif (1775-1783)</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress created the Continental Army on June 14, 1775, and Samuel and
      John Adams nominated Washington to become its commander in chief. Washi
      ngton was chosen over John Hancock because of his military experience a
      nd the belief that a Virginian would better unite the colonies. He was
      considered an incisive leader who kept his "ambition in check". He
      was unanimously elected commander in chief by Congress the next day.
      Washington appeared before Congress in uniform and gave an acceptance speech
      on June 16, declining a salary—though he was later reimbursed expenses. He was
      commissioned on June 19 and was roundly praised by Congressional delegates, i
      ncluding John Adams, who proclaimed that he was the man best suited to lead and
      unite the colonies. Congress appointed Washington "General & Commander
      in chief of the army of the United Colonies and of all the forces raised or to
      be raised by them", and instructed him to take charge of the siege of Boston
      on June 22, 1775.Congress chose his primary staff officers, including Major General Artemas Ward
      ,Adjutant General Horatio Gates, Major General Charles Lee, Major General Philip
      Schuyler, Major General Nathanael Greene, Colonel Henry Knox, and Colonel Alex
      ander Hamilton. Washington was impressed by Colonel Benedict Arnold and ga
      ve him responsibility for invading Canada. He also engaged French and Indian W
      ar compatriot Brigadier General Daniel Morgan. Henry Knox impressed Adams with
      ordnance knowledge, and Washington promoted him to colonel and chief of artillery.
      Washington initially protested enlistment of slaves in the Continental Army, but
      later he relented when the British emancipated and used theirs. On January
      16, 1776, Congress allowed free blacks to serve in the militia. By the end of
      the war one-tenth of Washington's army were blacks.</p>

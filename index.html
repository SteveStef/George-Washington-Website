<h1>How To CSS</h1>

<h2>How Does CSS Work?</h2>
<p class="para2">CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML
    components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:
This is my paragraph!
If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d
    use CSS code that looks like this:
p  {  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }
In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the part of CSS code specifying which HTML element the
    CSS styling will effect. In CSS, the selector is written to the left of the first curly bracket. The information
    between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains properties and values that are applied to the selector.
    Properties are things like font size, color, and margins, while values are the settings for those properties. In the
    example above, “color” and “font-weight” are both properties, and “pink” and “bold” are values. The full bracketed set of
{  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }
is the declaration, and again, “p” (meaning the HTML paragraph) is the selector. These same basic principles can be
    applied to change font sizes, background colors, margin indentations, and more. For instance. . .
body  {  background-color:lightblue;  }
. . .would make your page’s background light blue, or. . .
p  {  font-size:20px;  color:red;  }
. . .will create a 20 point font paragraph with red letters.</p>

<h3>Info on CSS:</h3>
    <p class="para3"> <span class="highlight">CSS</span> is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
    It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or
    printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from
    CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.
    This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p> <img class="imagec" src="whatisCSS.jpg" width="700" height="500">

<h4>CSS Moduels</h4>
<p id="para4">As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.
    You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a
    particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to
    find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also find links
    to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).
    At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find
    information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things
    and are therefore probably in the same specification.
    For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical
    sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.</p>
